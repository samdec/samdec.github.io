        <title>Google and Facebook: Algorithmic and Social Search</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeff Atwood recently posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html&quot;&gt;declining search quality of Google&lt;/a&gt;. After citing issues with spam sites and content farms out-ranking legitimate sites (like his own Stack Overflow), he concludes “Is the next generation of search destined to be less algorithmic and more social?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the stark contrast he asserts between algorithmic search and social search is misleading. Google’s algorithm is social because it treats a link like a vote of approval. It’s not so different from Hacker News or Reddit in that more votes generally mean higher ranking. The problem though is that many of those votes are not trustworthy or valuable. So Google’s real problem is, just like Hacker New’s problem, maintaining a community of good voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But defining “good community member” is a hard problem, a hard philosophical problem. What is needed is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for being a good community member, and harder still a set of conditions that can be measured. We can start by asserting that a good community member links to good websites and/or produces good content. What is a good website, what is good content? Well, those are also hard problems, let’s just say good is some combination of accurate, informative, useful, interesting, etc. and move on. Is a lot of unique visitors sufficient for being a good community member? Doesn’t seem so, the content farms and spam sites get many uniques (largely from Google itself, but traffic from Google shouldn’t factor into any ranking decisions because it would be circular; more traffic from Google leads to higher rankings which leads to more traffic from Google. You’d not get a meaningful ranking that way.).  Maybe high traffic is not sufficient, but what about necessary? Surely not, someone could start a site with nothing but excellent links and content, but get hardly any traffic. There are many factors which determine how much traffic a site gets, and good content/links is only one of them. So if not necessary, nor sufficient, is traffic a good surrogate for quality? Meaning, do higher traffic sites tend to be higher quality? If they do then traffic could be used for ranking. This process needs to be repeated for every measurable quality of a website, maybe sites with certain words or phrases on them tend to be higher quality, or maybe sites with more Twitter mentions are better, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook skirts around this issue by defining a good community member as your friend. The problem with this is two-fold: friends do not always produce good links, and nobody has enough friends to provide links to all the long-tail content they’d want. Solving the first problem is going to require some filtering (either by algorithm or by hand; maybe they will ask you to rate your friend’s interestingness and promote interesting friend’s links). Solving the second problem is going to make the first problem far, far worse. If you had enough friends to provide you with all the links you’d want, you’d have too many friends and never find any of the links you’d want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one that wins at search is going to be the one that figures out what a good community member is and how to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything is Vague</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise.” – Bertrand Russell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the purposes of philosophy is to define and clarify concepts by finding their necessary and sufficient conditions. A classic example used to illustrate this is the concept of a bachelor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What is a bachelor?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Well, an unmarried male.“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What about a baby boy, he’s an unmarried male, but certainly not a bachelor.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ok, an unmarried male of marriageable age.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What about the Pope? He’s an unmarried male of marriageable age, but not a bachelor.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hmm, alright, an unmarried male of marriageable age and marriageable status.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by the process of proposing definitions and counter-examples we eventually get a set of necessary and sufficient conditions. Except, not quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Define marriageable status.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It means you are able and willing to get married.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ok, but if all bachelors must be able to marry then none of them must be willing to marry, otherwise they’d all get married!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hmm… Alright, they just need to be willing to get married at some point in the future.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Well what about the so-called confirmed bachelor, they do not wish to marry at all, but they are still bachelors.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop there either. What about unmarried men in a committed relationship, how long does the relationship need to last before they stop being bachelors, what about open-relationships, how do you even define “committed relationship”? And so a concept as simple as bachelor becomes mired in complexity upon examination. Now think of all those concepts that are obviously complex even on the surface –justice, good and evil, consciousness, knowledge, etc.– and imagine how much more complex they become.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Or You Could Just</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, or you could just do…” Ever hear that from someone after you told them your business idea? It’s the knee-jerk reaction of dismissing an idea simply because it’s possible to do something similar already. Here’s some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It would be cool if there was a site where you could connect and share updates and photos with just your college friends.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Yeah, or you could use MySpace and Flickr.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What if I made a search engine that used links to rank pages?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“You could just use Yahoo.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What if I made some better blogging software and hosted people’s blog’s for free?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Yeah, but you could just use Movable Type and Typepad.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But businesses can succeed just being easier to use. The amount of people who do something is inversely proportional to how easy it is to do. Make something easier and you’ve got more customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;activation-energy&quot;&gt;ACTIVATION ENERGY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every chemical compound in nature has an inherent internal energy depending on its structure. When chemicals react they change their structure and thus their energy, usually a lower energy. Everything in nature strives to have the lowest possible energy. Yet reactions cannot proceed without the addition of some extra energy, even when the reaction would produce a lower energy overall. This added energy is called activation energy, it is the energy required to activate the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemical reactions are chaotic and seemingly random, but the lower the activation energy the more likely the reaction is to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every choice a person could make has an activation energy. It’s a lot more complex in people than in chemicals; instead of energy our activation depends on factors like our desire of the outcome, our desire and ability to change, and the difficulty of that change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lower the activation energy of a choice the more likely we are to make that choice. If you want something really bad, chances are that you’re going to try and get it. If you embrace change you’re more likely to choose change. If something is easy to do you’re more likely to do. We see this principle in action all the time. It’s the reason that if you want to stop eating junk food the first thing to do is to stop buying junk food. By making it more difficult to eat junk food (by adding the extra step of driving to the store and buying it) we end up eating less of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former two factors are internal, but the latter is external: it depends on your environment. Businesses can change the environment a lot more readily than they can people. They can change the environment by making their product easier to use and more accessible. That’s why it doesn’t matter that something can already be done as long as you make it easier to do. You can find lots of great business ideas just by looking at all the cool things people are doing with a lot of time, ingenuity, and hacks. Take what those people are doing and figure out how to make it easier so more people can do it, they’ll gladly pay for it&lt;/p&gt;
